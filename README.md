Capstone project for Springboard

# 1. Use of the either Google Books API https://developers.google.com/books or OpenLibrary https://openlibrary.org/developers/api 

Create something similar to Good Reads where users can keep track of their TBR lists, the date they added the book, the date they finished a book, and write notes and reviews about them. Users should have the ability to share the list with people. 

There would need to be a search functionality to find books by Author, Title, and Subject/Genre 

# 2. Theater History APP

Create a Theater History API and app to go with it. House plays by playwright, decade, first time it was produced, actors, historical significance, etc.
On the front end, users can search the API and get basic information about shows. Create a function that allows users to create their own collections so they can create lists of shows for their own entertainment or study purposes.

# 3. Use the Artsy API to create a study guide for students https://developers.artsy.net/v2/
Flashcard system of art images with the artist's name, the year it was created, the genre/style of the art work, summary of the art work, and the museum or current location. Allow users to search the database by artist, style/genre, period, etc. 
Users should be able to create their own collection so they can customize it to their needs. Card system with images on the front and then click to get the information. 



Option 1 for Capstone project 

1. What tech stack will you use for your final project?
   I'm planning on using React and MongoDB for my tech stack.
   
2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?
   I will be focusing on a full-stack application.

3.  Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
    My plan is to make this a website, but it could easily be a mobile app as well.
    
4.  What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
    The goal is to create a project that allows users to keep track of the books they have already read and ones they want to read.

5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?
   Users will be avid readers, book club members, and anyone else trying to keep track of their book interests.

6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may not have picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to     contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data.
   I'm going to collect user, book collections, and book data.
