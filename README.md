Capstone project for Springboard

# 1. Use of the either Google Books API https://developers.google.com/books or OpenLibrary https://openlibrary.org/developers/api 

Create something similar to Good Reads where users can keep track of their TBR lists, the date they added the book, the date they finished a book, and write notes and reviews about them. Users should have the ability to share the list with people. 

There would need to be a search functionality to find books by Author, Title, and Subject/Genre 

# 2. Theater History APP

Create a Theater History API and app to go with it. House plays by playwright, decade, first time it was produced, actors, historical significance, etc.
On the front end, users can search the API and get basic information about shows. Create a function that allows users to create their own collections so they can create lists of shows for their own entertainment or study purposes.

# 3. Use the Artsy API to create a study guide for students 
Flashcard system of art images with the artist's name, the year it was created, the genre/style of the art work, summary of the art work, and the museum or current location. Allow users to search the database by artist, style/genre, period, etc. 
Users should be able to create their own collection so they can customize it to their needs. Card system with images on the front and then click to get the information.
